# Project 1

# Part 1
Each Google sheet tab (on the bottom bar) corresponds to a different repo that we scored. The [software sustainability evaluation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform) responses are on row 7 to 76. Then the main [project 2 rubric](https://github.com/txt/se23/blob/main/docs/project2.md#grading-rubric) scores are below from rows 79 to 107, with an accompanying link as evidence if needed.

# Part 3
We wrote a 750 word reflection on what was hard about this process, how that pain could have been avoided, and some of the practices we are committing to perform in project2 to avoid that pain.
